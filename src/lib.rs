//! # Overview
//!
//! This crate provides sessions, key-value pairs associated with a site
//! visitor, as a [`tower`](https://docs.rs/tower/latest/tower/) middleware.
//!
//! It offers:
//!
//! - **Pluggable Storage Backends:** Arbitrary storage backends are implemented
//!   with the  [`SessionStore`] trait, fully decoupling sessions from their
//!   storage.
//! - **An `axum` Extractor for [`Session`]:** Applications built with `axum`
//!   can use `Session` as an extractor directly in their handlers. This makes
//!   using sessions as easy as including `Session` in your handler.
//! - **Common Backends Out-of-the-Box:** [`RedisStore`] and SQLx
//!   ([`SqliteStore`], [`PostgresStore`], [`MySqlStore`]) stores are available
//!   via their respective feature flags.
//! - **Simple Key-Value Interface:** Sessions offer a key-value interface that
//!   supports native Rust types. So long as these types are `Serialize` and can
//!   be converted to JSON, it's straightforward to insert, get, and remove any
//!   value.
//! - **Strongly-Typed Sessions:** Strong typing guarantees are easy to layer on
//!   top of this foundational key-value interface.
//!
//! # Usage with an `axum` application
//!
//! A common use-case for sessions is when building HTTP servers. Using `axum`,
//! it's straightforward to leverage sessions.
//!
//! ```rust,no_run
//! use std::net::SocketAddr;
//!
//! use axum::{
//!     error_handling::HandleErrorLayer, response::IntoResponse, routing::get, BoxError, Router,
//! };
//! use http::StatusCode;
//! use serde::{Deserialize, Serialize};
//! use time::Duration;
//! use tower::ServiceBuilder;
//! use tower_sessions::{MemoryStore, Session, SessionManagerLayer};
//!
//! const COUNTER_KEY: &str = "counter";
//!
//! #[derive(Default, Deserialize, Serialize)]
//! struct Counter(usize);
//!
//! #[tokio::main]
//! async fn main() {
//!     let session_store = MemoryStore::default();
//!     let session_service = ServiceBuilder::new()
//!         .layer(HandleErrorLayer::new(|_: BoxError| async {
//!             StatusCode::BAD_REQUEST
//!         }))
//!         .layer(
//!             SessionManagerLayer::new(session_store)
//!                 .with_secure(false)
//!                 .with_max_age(Duration::seconds(10)),
//!         );
//!
//!     let app = Router::new()
//!         .route("/", get(handler))
//!         .layer(session_service);
//!
//!     let addr = SocketAddr::from(([127, 0, 0, 1], 3000));
//!     axum::Server::bind(&addr)
//!         .serve(app.into_make_service())
//!         .await
//!         .unwrap();
//! }
//!
//! async fn handler(session: Session) -> impl IntoResponse {
//!     let counter: Counter = session.get(COUNTER_KEY).unwrap().unwrap_or_default();
//!
//!     session.insert(COUNTER_KEY, counter.0 + 1).unwrap();
//!
//!     format!("Current count: {}", counter.0)
//! }
//! ```
//!
//! # Implementation
//!
//! Sessions manifest to clients as cookies. These cookies have a configurable
//! name and a value that is the session ID. In other words, cookies hold a
//! pointer to the session in the form of an ID. This ID is a [UUID
//! v4](https://docs.rs/uuid/latest/uuid/struct.Uuid.html#method.new_v4).
//!
//! Session IDs are considered secure if your platform's
//! [`getrandom`](https://docs.rs/getrandom/latest/getrandom/) is
//! secure[^getrandom], and therefore are not signed or encrypted. Note that
//! this assumption is predicated on the secure nature of the UUID crate and its
//! ability to generate securely-random values. It's also important to note that
//! session cookies **must never** be sent over a public, insecure channel.
//! Doing so is **not** secure.
//!
//! An expiration time determines when the session will be considered expired.
//! This translates to the cookie's `max-age` attribute. By default,
//! [`CookieConfig`] will set this to `None`. When `None`, this means the cookie
//! will be treated as a ["session" cookie][session-cookie], not to be confused
//! with the session itself, which generally means that the cookie will expire
//! once the user closes their browser.
//!
//! ## Intermediary representation
//!
//! Sessions manage a `HashMap<String, serde_json::Value>` but importantly are
//! transparently persisted to an arbitrary storage backend. Effectively,
//! `HashMap` is an intermediay, in-memory representation. By using a map-like
//! structure, we're able to present a familiar key-value interface for managing
//! sessions. This also allows us to store and retrieve native Rust
//! types, so long as our type is `impl Serialize` and can be represented as
//! JSON.[^json]
//!
//! Internally, this hash map state is protected by a lock in the form of
//! `Mutex`. This allows us to safely share mutable state across thread
//! boundaries. Note that this lock is only acquired when we read from or write
//! to this inner session state and not used when the session is provided to the
//! request. This means that lock contention is minimized for most use
//! cases.[^lock-contention]
//!
//! The intermediary `HashMap` representation is converted to a
//! [`SessionRecord`] type which provides the structure needed to store
//! sessions. Implementations of `SessionStore` consume this type in order to
//! translate the session to its persisted form. Note that the exact details of
//! how a session is stored within a backend is left up to the implementation
//! but generally three things are needed:
//!
//! 1. The session ID.
//! 2. The session expiration time.
//! 3. The session data itself.
//!
//! Together, these compose the session record and are enough to both encode and
//! decode a session from any backend.
//!
//!  ## Session life cycle
//!
//! Cookies hold a pointer to the session, rather than the session's data and
//! because of this the `tower` middleware is focused on managng the process of
//! hydrating a session from the store. This works by first looking for a cookie
//! that matches our configured session cookie name. If no such cookie is found
//! or a cookie is found but the store has no such session or the session is no
//! longer active, we create a new session. However, it's important to note that
//! creating a session **does not** save the session to the store. In fact, the
//! store is not used at all unless one of two conditions is true:
//!
//! 1. A session cookie was found and we attempt to load it from the store via
//!    the [`load`](SessionStore::load) method or,
//! 2. A session was marked as modified or deleted.
//!
//! In other words, creating a new session is a lightweight process that does
//! not incur the overhead of talking to a store. It's also important to create
//! a session proactively as the middleware will attach the session to the
//! request as a request extension. This allows handlers to extract the cookie
//! from the request and manipulate it.
//!
//! Modified sessions will invoke the session store's
//! [`save`](SessionStore::save) method as well as send a `Set-Cookie` header.
//! While deleted sessions will either be:
//!
//! 1. Deleted, invoking the [`delete`](SessionStore::delete) method and setting
//!    a removal cookie or,
//! 2. Cycled, invoking the `delete` method but setting a new ID on the session;
//!    the session will have been marked as modified and so this will also set a
//!    `Set-Cookie` header on the response.
//!
//! # Extractor pattern
//!
//! When using `axum`, the [`Session`] will already function as an extractor.
//! It's possible to build further on this to create extractors of custom types.
//!
//! ```rust,no_run
//! # use async_trait::async_trait;
//! # use axum::extract::FromRequestParts;
//! # use http::{request::Parts, StatusCode};
//! # use serde::{Deserialize, Serialize};
//! # use tower_sessions::Session;
//! const COUNTER_KEY: &str = "counter";
//!
//! #[derive(Default, Deserialize, Serialize)]
//! struct Counter(usize);
//!
//! #[async_trait]
//! impl<S> FromRequestParts<S> for Counter
//! where
//!     S: Send + Sync,
//! {
//!     type Rejection = (http::StatusCode, &'static str);
//!
//!     async fn from_request_parts(req: &mut Parts, state: &S) -> Result<Self, Self::Rejection> {
//!         let session = Session::from_request_parts(req, state).await?;
//!         let counter: Counter = session.get(COUNTER_KEY).unwrap().unwrap_or_default();
//!         session.insert(COUNTER_KEY, counter.0 + 1).unwrap();
//!
//!         Ok(counter)
//!     }
//! }
//! ```
//!
//! Now in our handler, we can use `Counter` directly to read its fields.
//!
//! A complete example can be found in [`examples/counter-extractor.rs`](https://github.com/maxcountryman/tower-sessions/blob/main/examples/counter-extractor.rs).
//!
//! # Strongly-typed sessions
//!
//! The extractor pattern can be extended further to provide strong typing
//! guarantees over the key-value subtrate. Whereas our previous extractor
//! example was effectively read-only. This pattern enables mutability of the
//! underlying structure while also leveraging the full power of the type
//! system.
//!
//! ```rust,no_run
//! # use async_trait::async_trait;
//! # use axum::extract::FromRequestParts;
//! # use http::{request::Parts, StatusCode};
//! # use serde::{Deserialize, Serialize};
//! # use time::OffsetDateTime;
//! # use tower_sessions::Session;
//! # use uuid::Uuid;
//! #[derive(Clone, Deserialize, Serialize)]
//! struct GuestData {
//!     id: Uuid,
//!     pageviews: usize,
//!     first_seen: OffsetDateTime,
//!     last_seen: OffsetDateTime,
//! }
//!
//! impl Default for GuestData {
//!     fn default() -> Self {
//!         Self {
//!             id: Uuid::new_v4(),
//!             pageviews: 0,
//!             first_seen: OffsetDateTime::now_utc(),
//!             last_seen: OffsetDateTime::now_utc(),
//!         }
//!     }
//! }
//!
//! struct Guest {
//!     session: Session,
//!     guest_data: GuestData,
//! }
//!
//! impl Guest {
//!     const GUEST_DATA_KEY: &'static str = "guest_data";
//!
//!     fn id(&self) -> Uuid {
//!         self.guest_data.id
//!     }
//!
//!     fn first_seen(&self) -> OffsetDateTime {
//!         self.guest_data.first_seen
//!     }
//!
//!     fn last_seen(&self) -> OffsetDateTime {
//!         self.guest_data.last_seen
//!     }
//!
//!     fn pageviews(&self) -> usize {
//!         self.guest_data.pageviews
//!     }
//!
//!     fn mark_pageview(&mut self) {
//!         self.guest_data.pageviews += 1;
//!         Self::update_session(&self.session, &self.guest_data)
//!     }
//!
//!     fn update_session(session: &Session, guest_data: &GuestData) {
//!         session
//!             .insert(Self::GUEST_DATA_KEY, guest_data.clone())
//!             .unwrap()
//!     }
//! }
//!
//! #[async_trait]
//! impl<S> FromRequestParts<S> for Guest
//! where
//!     S: Send + Sync,
//! {
//!     type Rejection = (StatusCode, &'static str);
//!
//!     async fn from_request_parts(req: &mut Parts, state: &S) -> Result<Self, Self::Rejection> {
//!         let session = Session::from_request_parts(req, state).await?;
//!
//!         let mut guest_data: GuestData = session
//!             .get(Self::GUEST_DATA_KEY)
//!             .unwrap()
//!             .unwrap_or_default();
//!
//!         guest_data.last_seen = OffsetDateTime::now_utc();
//!
//!         Self::update_session(&session, &guest_data);
//!
//!         Ok(Self {
//!             session,
//!             guest_data,
//!         })
//!     }
//! }
//! ```
//!
//! Here we can use `Guest` as an extractor in our handler. We'll be able to
//! read values, like the ID as well as update the pageview count with our
//! `mark_pageview` method.
//!
//! A complete example can be found in [`examples/strongly-typed.rs`](https://github.com/maxcountryman/tower-sessions/blob/main/examples/strongly-typed.rs)
//!
//! ## Name-spaced and strongly-typed buckets
//!
//! Our example demonstrates a single extractor, but in a real application we
//! might imagine a set of common extractors, all living in the same session.
//! Each extractor forms a kind of bucketed name-space with a typed structure.
//! Importantly, each is self-contained by its own name-space.
//!
//! For instance, we might also have a site preferences bucket, an analytics
//! bucket, a feature flag bucket and so on. All these together would live in
//! the same session, but would be segmented by their own name-space, avoiding
//! the mixing of domains unnecessarily.[^data-domains]
//!
//! [^getrandom]: `uuid` uses `getrandom` which varies by platform; the crucial
//!   assumption
//! `tower-sessions` makes is that your platform is secure. However, you
//! **must** verify this for yourself.
//!
//! [^json]: Using JSON allows us to translate arbitrary types to virtually
//! any backend and gives us a nice interface with which to interact with the
//! session.
//!
//! [^lock-contention]: We might consider replacing `Mutex` with `RwLock` if
//! this proves to be a better fit in practice. Another alternative might be
//! `dashmap` or a different approach entirely. Future iterations should be
//! based on real-world use cases.
//!
//! [^data-domains]: This is paricularly useful when we may have data domains that only belong with
//! users in certain states: we can pull these into our handlers where we need a
//! particular domain. In this way, we minimize data pollution via
//! self-contained domains in the form of buckets.
